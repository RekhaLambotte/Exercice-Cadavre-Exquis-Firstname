Once upon a time

in Belgium ..


THE person was going out from the airport while checking his phone when suddenly it was so silent that the person took a look around and everyone was gone...

He pushes the skateboard with his foot. The skate rolls to a large yellow box located under the bed. It reads: "Plutonium - handle with care". He enters a key in a device connected to a very large amplifier.


All of a sudden, the amplifier made a resounding noise.

Surprised, the young man fell to the ground, his heart beating rapidly in his chest.

Other noises began to be heard, coming from another galaxy.
