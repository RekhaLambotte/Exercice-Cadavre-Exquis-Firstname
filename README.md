Once upon a time

in Belgium ..


THE person was going out from the airport while checking his phone when suddenly it was so silent that the person took a look around and everyone was gone...

He pushes the skateboard with his foot. The skate rolls to a large yellow box located under the bed. It reads: "Plutonium - handle with care". He enters a key in a device connected to a very large amplifier.


All of a sudden, the amplifier made a resounding noise.

Surprised, the young man fell to the ground, his heart beating rapidly in his chest.

Other noises began to be heard, coming from another galaxy.

Alors voyons voir si j'ai foutu le bor*** ou si j'ai failli Ã  ma mission !
